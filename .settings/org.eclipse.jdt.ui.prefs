Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&\#13;\r\n *     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&\#13;\r\n *     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&\#13;\r\n *     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&\#13;\r\n *     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&\#13;\r\n *     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&\#13;\r\n *     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&\#13;\r\n *     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&\#13;\r\n *     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&\#13;\r\n *     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&\#13;\r\n *&\#13;\r\n *  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&\#13;\r\n *&\#13;\r\n *  APPENDIX\: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&\#13;\r\n *&\#13;\r\n *     To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&\#13;\r\n *     boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"&\#13;\r\n *     replaced with your own identifying information.
